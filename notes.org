#+TITLE: simulating nonadecane: generation and shear

Operation 06.30.2022:

** making ambient sample on bigred3
- check jobscripts, infiles folder, monitor space consumed by a test run
- make DIR_PATH=AMB_MANY METHOD=submit M=T T=star CLUSTER=bigred3
- make clean DIR_PATH=AMB_MANY

Subtext: need to see if unsupervised ML can classify features in a complex molecular fluid

** Model file creation
- ensure that we both converge
- double check the architecture

** Initial sample generation at ambient (0.1 MPa, 293 K)
- finding the correct density and scaling factor for phase 1
- phase 2
- make sure no bubbles and slow generation

** From ambient pressure to other pressures
- from a unified script (no separate phases)
- make sure no bubbles

** Shear
